            "explanation": "There are two types of letters: sliceable and non-sliceable. Sliceable letters can be applied to any layer of the cube, while non-sliceable letters are applied to one or more specific layers. All letters are available in capital and non-capital variants but their meaning can change and depends additionally on the dimension of the cube. Rotations are always done clockwise unless the statement is modified by a prime. Modifications are always applied at the end of a notation statement. Notation statements need to be separated by spaces or commas.",
